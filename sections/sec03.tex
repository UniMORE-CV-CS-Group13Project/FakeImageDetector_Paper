\section{Data}\label{sec:Data}
The dataset used as a base in this project is ELSA\textunderscore D3\cite{baraldi2024contrastingdeepfakesdiffusioncontrastive, ELSAD3}. It is a multimodal dataset designed for deep fake detection. Among other information, the data structure provides, for each example, a URL pointing to a real image along with a description of such image, which is then used as a prompt to generate four synthetic variants:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{image\textunderscore gen0} $\rightarrow$ DeepFloyd/IF-II-L-v1.0;
    \item \texttt{image\textunderscore gen1} $\rightarrow$ CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4;
    \item \texttt{image\textunderscore gen2} $\rightarrow$ stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base;
    \item \texttt{image\textunderscore gen3} $\rightarrow$ stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0.
\end{itemize}
This organization proves to be particularly suitable for our setting, since it supports at the same time both the division between real and generated images and the multi-class source attribution.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Management}
Given the possibly large dimension of the dataset, we implemented a script that streams dataset chunks, downloading real images through HTTP requests using the provided URL, and retrieving generated ones directly from the dataset chunk itself. \par
During this acquisition phase, a validity check is performed on URLs and content types to ensure that only valid images are processed, discarding any corrupted or unreachable links, and the related generated images. \par
To optimize memory usage and enable scalable storage, all images are converted to raw bytes and written progressively in Parquet chunks. \par
In our configuration, the acquisition process collects a total of $16.384$ dataset entries, each containing five images (one per class), making our custom dataset of $81.920$ images perfectly balanced.
