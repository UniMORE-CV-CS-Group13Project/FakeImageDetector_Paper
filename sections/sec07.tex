\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, the Ensemble Classifier exhibits satisfactory performances especially when distinguishing between real and synthetic images. The difficulties in discerning between synthetic images coming from different generators but belonging to the same family - after observing steady improvements during the training and validation plots across epochs - could be partly attributed to the relatively small size of the working dataset.
\subsection{Future Works}
Future improvements could involve expanding the range of models to discriminate from, thereby increasing the number of classes. This would require augmenting the current dataset, but could yield more comprehensive results as newer and different generators are introduced. Moreover, an additional class ``\texttt{Others}'' could be implemented in order to not only recognize that the image is fake, but also that it is generated by an unknown model. Our experiment demonstrated that it is possible to work in the frequency domain to discriminate between real and fake images with satisfactory accuracy, even under suboptimal conditions. \par
Improving preprocessing techniques further could better the results of the network. \par
Attempts with a light denoising pass over the greyscale images were made. The aim was to preserve the majority of the high-frequency noise patterns in order to keep the discriminant parts of the generated images, but the results were similar to the ones showed above with no denoising applied (see \autoref{App:Denoising}). \par
Another improvement could be to try and average batches of real images belonging to one class, in an effort to try and enhance the common features between them. This last option has not been explored due to the small size of the dataset. \par
Finally, treating different semantics from the input channels separately could be another area to explore, thus increasing the model complexity and implying the necessity of a larger preprocessed portion of the Elsa\textunderscore D3\cite{ELSAD3,baraldi2024contrastingdeepfakesdiffusioncontrastive} Dataset.
